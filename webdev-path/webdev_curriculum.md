  - Browser automation
  - Visual regression testing
  - CI/CD integration

#### Hands-on Exercises

1. **Unit Tests**: Write tests for utility functions (date formatting, calculations)
2. **Component Tests**: Test React components (form, table, chart)
3. **API Tests**: Test all REST endpoints with Supertest
4. **Integration Tests**: Test React components with API calls
5. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user journey (signup → dashboard → logout)

⚡ **AI Generate**: "Generate Jest test cases for user authentication service"
🔍 **AI Explain**: "Explain difference between unit, integration, and E2E tests with examples"
💡 **Ask AI**: "What's the 80/20 rule for testing? What should I prioritize?"
🤖 **AI Debug**: "React Testing Library test failing. Error: 'Unable to find element'. Code: [code]"

#### Common Pitfalls

❌ **Testing Mistakes**:
- Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- Not testing error states and edge cases
- Over-relying on snapshot tests
- Writing tests after code (write tests first or alongside!)

❌ **React Testing Mistakes**:
- Using wrong query (getBy vs queryBy vs findBy)
- Not waiting for async updates (use waitFor, findBy)
- Testing internal component state directly
- Not cleaning up after tests (memory leaks)

❌ **E2E Mistakes**:
- Tests that are too brittle (break on small UI changes)
- Not waiting for elements properly (flaky tests)
- Too many E2E tests (slow, expensive)

🤖 **AI Debug**: "My tests pass locally but fail in CI. Why?"
