## Pain Points & Where BI Helps

### Thai F&B Specific Challenges

#### 1. Weather Dependency (Street Vendors)
**Problem**: Rain = zero revenue, but already bought ingredients

**BI Solution**:
- Track weather vs sales correlation
- Forecast using 7-day weather + historical
- Adjust next-day ingredient purchase based on forecast
- **Dashboard**: Weather-adjusted buying recommendation

---

#### 2. Location Optimization (Mobile Vendors)
**Problem**: Which spot makes most money?

**BI Solution**:
- Track revenue by location-time combination
- Compare Monday 6pm Silom vs Tuesday 6pm Sathorn
- Factor: Setup/travel cost, competition, foot traffic
- **Dashboard**: Optimal weekly schedule by location

---

#### 3. Cash vs PromptPay Analysis
**Problem**: Are digital payments costing or helping?

**BI Solution**:
- Transaction time: Cash vs QR
- Customer preference trends
- Bank fees vs cash handling risk
- Volume increase from accepting digital
- **Dashboard**: Payment method impact analysis

---

#### 4. Talad Price Fluctuation
**Problem**: Shrimp ฿250/kg yesterday, ฿380/kg today

**BI Solution**:
- Track ingredient prices daily
- Alert when spike >20%
- Suggest menu adjustment (temporary out of stock)
- Calculate break-even price if continue
- **Dashboard**: Ingredient cost tracker + pricing recommendations

---

#### 5. Peak Hour Capacity
**Problem**: Queue too long, losing customers

**BI Solution**:
- Track queue length (proxy: orders/hour)
- Analyze sold-out times (demand > capacity)
- Calculate revenue lost to queue
- ROI of hiring helper or second cart
- **Dashboard**: Capacity optimization analysis

---
