### NYC Rent Burden (Crushing!)

**Manhattan Rent Examples** (2026):
```
Times Square:
- 1,500 sq ft: $60,000/month ($40/sq ft!)
- Need $2,000/day just for rent
- = 50 customers/day × $40 check

SoHo:
- 1,200 sq ft: $35,000/month
- Need $1,167/day
- = 35 customers × $35

Upper West Side:
- 1,000 sq ft: $18,000/month
- Need $600/day
- = 25 customers × $25

Brooklyn Williamsburg:
- 1,500 sq ft: $15,000/month
- Need $500/day
- = 30 customers × $17

Queens Flushing:
- 1,500 sq ft: $8,000/month
- Need $267/day
- = 20 customers × $13
```

**Rent % of Revenue** (Industry Standard vs NYC Reality):
```
Industry Standard: 6-10%
NYC Reality:
- Manhattan: 8-15% (struggling if >12%)
- Brooklyn: 6-10%
- Queens: 5-8%

Strategy:
- High rent → MUST have high turnover OR high check average
- Cannot survive with low volume + low prices in Manhattan
- Queens model: Low rent + high volume + low prices = works!
```

### Labor Costs (NYC Minimum Wage Impact)

**NYC Minimum Wage** (2026):
```
Tipped Workers: $13.50/hr (cash wage)

```

**Labor % of Revenue**:

- NYC pays $16k-24k more/month!
```

**Major Food Halls**:

- Urbanspace (Midtown)

**Vendor Economics** (Food Hall Stall):
```

+ Revenue share: 10-15% to food hall operator

Space: 200-400 sq ft (tiny!)
Seating: Shared (food hall provides)
Staff: 2-4 (small team)

Revenue:
Daily Covers: 80-150
Average: $18-25

)

```

## NYC Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Health Grade Impact

**Problem**:
- B grade = -20-30% revenue instantly!
- Re-inspection takes 2-4 weeks
- Permanent damage to reputation possible

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Health Inspection Preparedness"
Track:
- Days since last inspection (avg 6 months between)
- Self-audit checklist daily (temp logs, cleanliness)
- Revenue by grade (quantify impact)

Alert when inspection likely:
- "180 days since last inspection → expect visit soon"
- "Daily self-audit: 3 violations found → FIX before inspector!"

Impact Analysis:
- "B grade posted 5 days ago → revenue -22%"
- "Re-inspection scheduled 12 days out → lost revenue $45k"
- "Emergency deep clean → cost $3k → re-inspection → A grade → revenue recovered"
```

---

### 2. Rent Renewal Crisis

**Problem**:
- NYC leases: 10-year terms common
- Renewal: Landlord can increase 20-50%!
- Refuse = forced to relocate (lose customers, brand)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Lease Renewal Watchdog"
Track:
- Lease expiration (alert 18 months ahead)
- Comparable rents in neighborhood (trending up/down?)
- Revenue trend (can afford +30% rent?)

Scenario Planning:
- "Rent renewal +35% = $15k → $20.25k"
- "Need +$175k annual revenue to maintain margins"
- "= +15 customers/day at current average"
- "OR relocate to Brooklyn (save $8k/month)"

Negotiation Data:
- "3 vacancies within 2 blocks (landlord competition)"
- "Your rent $25k, comparable $22k → negotiate down"
```

---

### 3. Delivery Commission Burden

**Problem**:
- DoorDash/Uber Eats: 25-30% commission
- NYC law caps at 15% for pickup, but delivery uncapped
- Small margins can't absorb

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Delivery Profitability Tracker"
Compare:
Dine-in Order:
- Revenue: $65
- Food: $20 (31%)
- Labor (server): $8
- Net: $37 (57%)

Delivery Order (Uber Eats):
- Revenue: $65
- Food: $20 (31%)
- Uber commission: $19.50 (30%)
- Packaging: $2
- Labor (kitchen only): $3
- Net: $20.50 (32%) ← HALF the margin!

Strategy:
- Limit delivery to slow times (fill excess capacity)
- Own delivery for regulars (cut out Uber)
- Minimum order $40 (delivery economics work better)
```
