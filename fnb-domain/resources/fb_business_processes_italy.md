### 3. Espresso Culture

**What is it**: Standing espresso at bar, Italian ritual

**Italian Coffee Rules**:
```
Ordering:
- "Un caffè" = espresso (never say "espresso"!)
- Cappuccino = ONLY breakfast (never after 11am!)
- Ordering cappuccino after lunch = tourist!

Pricing:
- Standing at bar: €1-1.20
- Sitting at table: €3-5 (3-4× price!)
- Tourists sit, locals stand

Speed:
- Order, drink (30 seconds), leave
- Not a "hang out" spot (that's aperitivo time!)
```

---

### 4. Pizza (Naples vs Rome)

**Regional Differences**:
```
Naples Pizza:
- Soft, floppy crust
- San Marzano tomatoes (DOP!)
- Buffalo mozzarella
- Wood-fired
- €5-8 (cheap!)

Rome Pizza:
- Thin, crispy crust (pizza al taglio = by slice)
- Rectangular (not round!)
- Sold by weight (€3-5 for big slice)

Milan: Chicago-style influence (thicker, American-style)
```

---

## Italian Food Traditions (Strict!)

### Pasta Rules

**What NOT to do**:
```
Breaking spaghetti: CRIME!  
Chicken + pasta: Never combine
Cappuccino after dinner: Tourist mistake
Parmesan on seafood pasta: FORBIDDEN!

Why:
- Tradition sacred
- "Non si fa!" (It's not done!)
- Locals judge hard
```

---

### Coperto (Cover Charge)

**What is it**: €2-4 per person table charge

**Why Exists**:
```
Included:
- Bread
- Table setting
- "Right to sit"

Not a Tip:
- Separate from service
- Even locals pay
- Some tourists think it's a scam (it's not!)
```

## Italy Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Regional Cuisine Confusion

**Problem**:
- Tourists expect "Italian food"
- But: Carbonara (Rome), Risotto (Milan), Pizza (Naples)
- Serving wrong dish in wrong region = locals angry!

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Menu Regional Authenticity"
Track:
- Customer origin (tourists vs locals)
- Dish popularity by customer type
- Complaints about "not authentic"

Strategy:
- Rome restaurant: Focus on Roman dishes (carbonara, amatriciana)
- Don't try to be "all of Italy" (locals know you're fake!)
- Tourist menu vs local menu (regional specialties for locals)
```

---

### 2. Aperitivo Cannibalization

**Problem**:
- Aperitivo 6-9pm: High margin (70%)
- But: Customers fill up on free buffet, skip dinner!
- Dinner revenue: -30%

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Aperitivo vs Dinner Revenue"
Track:
- Aperitivo covers
- Dinner covers (do apert-goers stay?)
- Total daily revenue (is aperitivo cannibalizing dinner?)

Finding:
- Aperitivo customers: 80% leave after (don't order dinner)
- Dinner-only customers: Down 25% (filled up at aperitivo elsewhere)

Strategy:
- Limit aperitivo buffet quality (don't make TOO good!)
- Aperitivo = marketing (get them in, upsell dinner)
- Or: Commit to aperitivo-only (skip dinner entirely, high margins)
```
