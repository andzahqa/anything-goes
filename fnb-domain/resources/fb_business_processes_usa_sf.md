## SF Signature F&B

### 1. Farm-to-Table Fine Dining

**What is it**: Direct farmer relationships, seasonal menus

**SF Farm-to-Table Standard**:
```
Expectations:
- Name the farmer on menu ("Johnson Family Farm tomatoes")
- Change menu monthly (seasonal)
- Organic certification standard
- Compostable everything
- Carbon footprint tracking

vs Other Cities:
- NYC: Farm-to-table = premium positioning
- SF: Farm-to-table = TABLE STAKES (everyone does it!)
```

**Economics** (Marina District Farm-to-Table):
```
Rent: $15,000/month (SF expensive but not NYC level)
Seating: 60

Covers: 90-120/day
Average: $85 (3-course prix fixe common)
Daily: $7,650-10,200
Monthly: $198,900-265,200

Costs:
- Food: 38% = $76k-101k (farmer-direct expensive!)
- Rent: $15k (6-8%)
- Labor: 32% = $64k-85k
- Compostable packaging: $800
- Farmer relationship events: $500 (dinners, farm visits)
Total: $156k-202k (78-76%)

Net: $43k-63k/month (22-24%)

Marketing:
- Farmer stories (Instagram gold!)
- "Yesterday picked, today served" (freshness)
- But: Weather risk (crop failure = menu scramble!)
```

### 2. Mission Burrito (SF Signature)

**What is it**: SF-style burrito, bigger than traditional Mexican

**Mission vs Regular Burrito**:
```
Regular (Mexico/LA): 8-10 oz, $5-7
Mission SF: 16-20 oz!, $10-14

What's Inside:
- Rice (more than traditional)
- Beans
- Meat (carne asada, carnitas, al pastor)
- Cheese, sour cream, guacamole
- Foil-wrapped (eat with hands)

Famous Spots:
- La Taqueria (no rice, purist favorite)
- El Farolito (24-hour, drunk food)
- Taqueria Cancun
```

**Economics** (Mission District Taqueria):
```
Rent: $8,000/month (Mission cheaper than downtown)
Seating: 40 + takeout heavy

Daily Sales:
Burritos: 200-350 × $12 avg = $2,400-4,200
Tacos: 100-150 × $4 = $400-600
Drinks: $300-500
Total: $3,100-5,300

Monthly: $80,600-137,800

Costs:
- Food: 32% = $26k-44k
- Rent: $8k (6-10%)

- Utilities: $1.5k
Total: $58.5k-92.5k (73-67%)

Net: $22.1k-45.3k/month (27-33%)

Tech Worker Lunch:
- Lines 11:30am-1:30pm (tech offices nearby)
- $20-30 company lunch stipends = burritos perfect!
- Repeat customers (same burrito, every Wednesday!)
```

---

### 3. Tech Company Cafeterias (Unique SF Phenomenon)

**What is it**: Free gourmet meals for employees

**Tech Cafeteria Model** (Google, Facebook, etc.):
```
Not a "Restaurant":
- Company-run or contracted
- Free for employees
- Michelin-level chefs!
- Unlimited food

Why Companies Do It:
- Keep employees on campus longer
- Recruitment tool ("Free lunch!")
- Morale/retention
- Cost: $10-15/employee/day
- Benefit: Employees work through lunch

Example: Google SF
- 3+ cafeterias per building
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner free
- Sushi bar, taco bar, salad bar, hot entrees
- Snacks, drinks 24/7
```

**Impact on SF F&B Market**:
```
Problem for Restaurants:
- Lost lunch market (tech workers eat free on campus!)
- Must target dinner, weekends

Opportunity:
- Ex-tech cafeteria chefs open restaurants
- "Former Google chef" = marketing gold
- Higher food quality standards (compete with free cafeterias!)
```

### 4. Asian Fusion (SF Innovation)

**What is it**: Asian techniques + Western ingredients or vice versa

**SF Asian Fusion Characteristics**:
```
Examples:
- Ramen burger (noodle bun)
- Kimchi quesadilla
- Miso-glazed salmon
- Sake cocktails with Western spirits

Why SF:
- 34% Asian population (authentic Asian techniques)
- Tech "innovation" culture (experimentation encouraged)
- Wealthy

 (willing to pay for novelty)
```

**Economics** (SOMA Asian Fusion):
```
Rent: $18,000/month (SOMA tech district)
Seating: 70

Lunch (Tech Workers):
Covers: 100-140 × $22 = $2,200-3,080

Dinner (Date Night):
Covers: 80-110 × $65 = $5,200-7,150

Daily: $7,400-10,230
Monthly: $192,400-265,980

Costs:
- Food: 34% = $65k-90k (specialty ingredients!)
- Rent: $18k (7-9%)
- Labor: 30% = $58k-80k
- Fusion R&D (testing dishes): $2k
Total: $143k-190k (74-71%)

Net: $49k-76k/month (26-29%)

Tech Lunch Stipends:
- $20-30/day common (Salesforce, Twitter, Uber)
- Lunch checks higher (company pays!)
- Dinner = date night (couples, personal $)
```

## SF Operational Dynamics

### Sustainability Obsession (Not Optional!)

**SF Requirements**:
```
Mandatory:
- Compostable takeout containers (plastic banned!)
- Provide compost bin (customers separate waste)
- Organic when possible
- Local sourcing (document & display)

Fines:
- Plastic straws: $500 fine!
- Styrofoam: $1,000 fine
- No compost program: $500 fine

Cost Impact:
Compostable container: $0.80 each
Plastic container: $0.15 each
= $0.65 more per order!

100 takeout orders/day × $0.65 = $65/day
= $1,690/month extra cost

But: Customer expectation (won't patronize if not sustainable)
```

### Tech IPO Boom/Bust Cycles

**SF Economic Volatility**:
```
IPO Boom (2021, 2024):
- Tech workers get stock payouts
- "Celebration dinners" spike
- High-end restaurants: +40% revenue
- Reservations impossible

Bust/Layoffs (2022-2023):
- Tech layoffs 20%+
- Lunch crowd disappears
- Revenue: -30-40%
- Many restaurants close

BI Critical:
- Track tech company news (layoffs, IPOs)
- Diversify customer base (not just tech!)
- Cash reserves for bust periods
```

---

## SF Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Tech Worker Dependence (Risky!)

**Problem**:
- 60-70% customers = tech workers
- Tech layoffs = instant -40% revenue
- COVID WFH = lunch business died

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Customer Segment Diversification"
Track:
- % revenue from tech workers (credit card data, location)
- Lunch vs dinner ratio (lunch = mostly tech)
- Neighborhood mix (SOMA = 80% tech, Mission = 40%)

Target:
- Tech workers: <50% of revenue (diversify!)
- Build tourist business
- Local resident regulars
- Weekend brunch (non-tech)
```

---

### 2. Sustainability Cost Burden

**Problem**:
- Compostable containers +$0.65 each
- Organic ingredients +30%
- Local sourcing (can't buy cheap from far away)
- Higher food cost % than other cities

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Sustainability ROI Tracker"
Track:
- Premium paid for organic/local vs conventional
- Customer willingness to pay (SF customers okay with +20% prices)
- Marketing value (sustainability story attracts conscious consumers)

Finding:
- Food cost: 38% (vs national 30%)
- But: Can charge +25% prices (SF accepts premium for values)
- Net: Same margin, higher absolute revenue
```

---

### 3. Hills & Delivery Logistics

**Problem**:
- SF famous for hills (45° streets!)
- Delivery drivers struggle
- Food arrives cold (long uphill drive)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Delivery Zone Profitability"
Track:
- Revenue by neighborhood
- Delivery time average
- Driver acceptance rate (do they take the order?)

Findings:
- Nob Hill: -35% driver acceptance (too steep!)
- Mission (flat): 90% acceptance
- Richmond (far): Long delivery = cold food = complaints

Strategy:
- Limit delivery radius (quality control)
- Surcharge for hills (+$3 for Nob Hill)
- OR: Insulated bags investment ($200, keeps hot)
```
