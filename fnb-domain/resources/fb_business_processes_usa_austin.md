## Austin Signature Foods

### 1. Texas BBQ (Central Texas Style)

**What is it**: Slow-smoked meat, simple rubs, no sauce needed

**Central Texas BBQ Rules**:
```
Meat:
- Brisket (king of Texas BBQ!)
- Pork ribs
- Sausage (Czech/German influence)
- Beef ribs (dino ribs!)

Cooking:
- Oak wood smoke (12-18 hours!)
- Salt & pepper rub (that's IT, no fancy spices)
- No sauce (meat stands alone)

Served:
- Butcher paper
- White bread slices
- Pickles, onions
- Sauce on side (optional, purists skip)
```

**Franklin Barbecue Model** (Most Famous):
```
Operating: Tue-Sun, 11am-sold out (usually 1-2pm!)
Line: Forms at 6am, 2-4 hour wait common
Pricing: $22-32/lb (expensive but worth it!)

Daily Sales (estimate):
- 1,200 lbs meat/day
- Average: $26/lb
- Daily: $31,200
- Monthly (22 days): $686,400

But: Owner Aaron Franklin works smoker 12-16 hrs/day!
```

**Economics** (Mid-Tier BBQ Joint - East Austin):
```
Rent: $8,000/month (East Austin gentrifying)
Seating: 80 + takeout

- Wood (oak): $800-1,200/month (burn LOTS)
- Brisket: $4-6/lb wholesale, sell $18-25/lb

Brisket Gamble:

```

**BBQ Line Culture**:
```
Franklin BBQ Line:
- People arrive 5-6am (opens 11am!)

- Sold out by 1-2pm daily

Economics of Scarcity:
- Sell out = FOMO marketing (free!)

Labor:
Restaurant: 8-15 staff
Truck: 2-4 staff

Revenue Potential:
Restaurant: $150k-300k/month
Truck: $30k-80k/month

But: ROI similar or better on trucks!
```

**Food Truck Lot Economics** (Austin Innovation):
```
What is it: 5-15 food trucks, shared seating area

Lot Rent: $800-1,500/truck/month
Amenities: Picnic tables, lights, music
Benefits: Foot traffic, variety attracts customers

```

## Austin Tech Boom Impact

### Tech Workers (Changing Austin F&B)

**Silicon Hills**:
```
Tech Companies:
- Google, Apple, Tesla, Oracle relocating
- 50,000+ tech workers (2020-2026)
- Salaries: $120k-250k (high spending power!)

Impact on F&B:
- Lunch demand surge (office parks need food)
- Delivery adoption (tech workers = apps)
- Higher prices acceptable (vs old Austin cheap)
- Craft cocktails, wine bars growing

Tension:
- Old Austin: Cheap, weird, local
- New Austin: Expensive, polished, chains creeping in
- "Keep Austin Weird" vs gentrification
```

---

### SXSW & ACL (Music Festival Surges)

**SXSW (South by Southwest) - March**:
```
Normal March Week: $18k
SXSW Week: $65k (+261%!)

Impact:
- 400,000 visitors (music, film, tech conference)
- Every restaurant booked
- Food trucks 3× normal revenue
- Bars open til 4am (live music + drinking)

Challenge:
- Staff exhaustion (10 days straight, 14hr shifts)
- Supply chain (triple orders, hope enough!)
- Price surge (but visitors expect it)
```

**ACL (Austin City Limits) - October**:
```
Music Festival (2 weekends):
- 75,000 attendees each weekend
- Zilker Park vendors (festival permits expensive!)
- Surrounding restaurants boom

Revenue: +150% those weekends
```

## Austin Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. BBQ Brisket Waste (Quality Control)

**Problem**:
- 30% of brisket "doesn't pass" (dry, tough, bad)
- Can't serve bad brisket (reputation essential!)
- $1,500-2,500/week waste

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Brisket Quality Tracker"
Track:
- Pass rate by pit master (who's consistent?)
- Pass rate by brisket supplier (quality variance?)
- Temperature logs (smoke temp correlation with pass/fail)
- Wood type (oak vs pecan impact?)

Findings:
- Pit master A: 78% pass rate
- Pit master B: 64% pass rate
- Supplier X briskets: 72% pass
- Supplier Y briskets: 81% pass!

Optimization:
- Train Pit master B (or replace)
- Switch to Supplier Y (higher cost but less waste = net savings!)
- Failed brisket → chop for sandwiches (salvage revenue)
```

---

### 2. SXSW Revenue Planning

**Problem**:
- SXSW March: $65k (insane!)
- April-February: $18k avg (normal)
- Cash flow planning critical

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "SXSW Surplus Allocation"
Track:
- SXSW revenue vs normal month
- Surplus: $65k - $18k = $47k extra
- Slow summer months (June-Aug, hot!) need reserves

Plan:
- Save $30k from SXSW for summer shortfall
- Equipment upgrades (new smoker $25k, save up!)
- Staff bonuses (worked 14-hour days, 10 days straight)
- Tax reserves (IRS quarterly payments)
```

---

### 3. "Keep Austin Weird" vs Corporate Chains

**Problem**:
- Austin identity = local, weird, independent
- Chains entering (Starbucks vs local coffee)
- Customers choose local (even if more expensive!)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Local vs Chain Customer Preference"
Track:
- Revenue impact of new chain nearby
- Customer surveys (local loyalty strength)
- Marketing: "Locally owned since 20XX" messaging

Finding:
- Starbucks opens 2 blocks away
- My revenue: -8% (some customers lost)
- But: Loyal base stays (+5% price increase tolerated!)
- Emphasize local ownership = competitive advantage

Strategy:
- Local marketing (community events, sponsorships)
- "Austin-owned" messaging prominent
- Can't compete on convenience, compete on authenticity
```

---

### 4. Tech Worker Lunch Delivery Surge

**Problem**:
- Office parks: No walkable lunch options
- Delivery demand: 60% of weekday lunch
- Delivery commission: 25-30%

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Corporate Lunch Program Performance"
Track:
- Delivery commission cost
- Direct corporate accounts (bypass apps)
- Catering vs individual orders

Strategy:
- Direct partnership with tech companies
- "Lunch program": Company pays, employees choose
- Cut out DoorDash (save 30%)!
- Minimum order: 10 employees
- Win: Company pays invoice, you keep 30% margin

Example:
- Google office: 200 employees
- 50 order lunch daily × $18 = $900/day
- No delivery fee (direct contract)!
- Monthly: $900 × 22 = $19,800 (stable revenue!)
```
