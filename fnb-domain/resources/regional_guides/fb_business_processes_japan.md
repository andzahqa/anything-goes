## Financial Metrics

### Japan-Specific KPIs

**Ramen Shop Metrics**:

**Turnover Rate**:
```
Target: 15-20 turns/day (for 12 seats)

```

**Broth Cost %**:
```
Critical Metric: Broth ingredients / Revenue
Target: 12-18%

Alert: >20% (waste or over-portioning)
```

---

### Izakaya Metrics

```
Ideal: 55% drinks, 45% food by revenue

Why:
- Drinks: 70-80% margin

```

**Otoshi (Cover Charge) % of Revenue**:

## Challenges & BI Solutions

### Japan F&B Pain Points

#### 1. Labor Shortage Crisis

**Problem**:
- Aging society: 30% over 65
- Declining birth rate: Fewer young workers
- Immigration restrictive: Hard to hire foreigners
- Manual jobs unattractive: Youth prefer office work

**Current State**:
- Restaurants close due to no staff
- Shorter operating hours
- Wage inflation (minimum ¥1,150/hr → ¥1,300/hr)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Labor Efficiency Optimizer"
Track:
- Revenue per labor hour
- Peak hour staffing vs revenue
- Automation ROI (ticket machines, tablets)

Recommendations:
- "Peak 12-1pm = 3 staff generates ¥180k, off-peak 3pm 2 staff = ¥40k"
- "Implement tablet ordering → reduce 1 staff = save ¥250k/month"
- "Close Mon-Tue (slowest days) saves ¥500k labor, loses ¥400k revenue = ¥100k net gain"
```

---

#### 2. Cash Management (Tax Evasion Risk)

**Problem**:
- 70% cash transactions
- Temptation to under-report (avoid tax)
- Hard to track actual sales
- Audit risk

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Sales Reconciliation Tracker"
Compare:
- POS registered sales
- Cash in register
- Ingredient purchasing vs portions sold

Anomaly Detection:
- "Sold 180 bowls but ingredients for 200 → 20 bowls unregistered?"
- "Cash deposit ¥300k but POS shows ¥420k → ¥120k missing?"

Recommendation: Full POS integration, minimize cash handling
```

---

#### 3. Seasonal Revenue Fluctuations

**Problem**:
- Cherry blossom season (March-April): +40% revenue (tourists!)
- Rainy season (June-July): -20% revenue
- Golden Week (early May): +60% revenue
- O-Bon (August): -30% revenue (everyone travels)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Seasonal Revenue Forecaster"
Track:
- Historical patterns by month
- Tourist season correlation
- Holiday impact

Cash Flow Planning:
- "Save ¥800k from April surplus for June shortage"
- "Hire 2 temporary staff for Golden Week (ROI: 240%)"
- "Reduce inventory orders in August (O-Bon exodus)"
```

---

#### 4. Michelin Pressure

**Problem**:
- Michelin rating = huge business impact
- +1 star = +200% bookings
- -1 star = -60% bookings
- Extreme pressure to maintain

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Quality Consistency Monitor"
Track:
- Ingredient sourcing (premium suppliers)
- Dish execution time variance (consistency)
- Customer feedback sentiment (pre-Michelin visit indicators)
- Food cost % (maintain quality even if profit suffers)

Alert:
- "Fish supplier changed = quality risk!"
- "Execution time variance +20% = training needed"
```

---

#### 5. Konbini Competition

**Problem**:
- 7-Eleven sells ¥500 bento that rivals ¥1,000 restaurant meals
- Fresh 24/7, no wait
- Restaurants losing quick-meal customers

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Competitive Positioning Analysis"
Track:
- Lunch customer count trend (declining?)
- Average check (customers trading down?)
- Speed of service (if slower than konbini → problem)

Differentiation Strategy:
- "Cannot compete on price → focus on experience"
- "Omotenashi service (konbini can't replicate)"
