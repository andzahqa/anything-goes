## UK Signature F&B

### 1. Gastropub Model

**What is it**: Pub with restaurant-quality food

**Gastropub Evolution**:
```
Traditional Pub (1990s):
- Beer + crisps
- Maybe microwaved pie
- Focus: Drinking

Gastropub (2000s+):
- Chef-driven menu
- £14-22 mains
- Craft beer + wine
- 50/50 food/drink revenue

Why Worked:
- Pubs struggling (beer sales down)
- Add food = new revenue stream
- Casual atmosphere (vs formal restaurant)
```

**Economics** (London Gastropub - Islington):
```
Rent: £8,000/month
Seating: 60 + bar standing

Revenue Split:
Food (lunch+dinner): 55% = £86k
Drinks (beer, wine, spirits): 45% = £71k
Total: £157,000/month

Costs:
- Food: 32% of food revenue = £28k
- Drinks: 25% of drink revenue = £18k
- Rent: £8k (5%)
- Labor: 35% = £55k (UK minimum £11.44/hr 2026)
- Utilities: £4k
Total: £113k (72%)

Net: £44k/month (28%)

Drink Margins Save It:
- Food alone: 32% cost, 35% labor = barely profitable
- Drinks: 25% cost, included labor = 75% gross!
- Combined: Makes gastropub work
```

### 2. Sunday Roast Tradition

**What is it**: Traditional British Sunday meal (12-5pm)

**Sunday Roast Components**:
```
Meat:

```

**Economics** (Sunday Roast Impact):

Why So Popular:
- Family tradition (multi-generational)
- Good value (£18 for huge meal)

Challenge:
- Prep intensive (roast takes 3-4 hours!)
- One day/week only
- Must nail it (reputation essential)
```

## UK Regulations & Challenges

```

### Brexit Impact (Labor + Ingredients)

**Labor Shortage**:
```
Pre-Brexit:
- EU workers: 30-40% of London restaurant staff!
- Easy hiring (freedom of movement)

Post-Brexit (2021+):
- EU workers need visa (hard to get!)
- Hospitality worker shortage: -15% staff
- Wage pressure: +20-30% to attract workers

Impact:
- Labor cost: 35% → 42% of revenue (+20%!)
- Reduced hours (can't staff fully)
- Service quality drop (understaffing)
```

**Ingredient Costs**:
```
Import Tariffs/Delays:
- French cheese: +15% cost (tariffs)
- Spanish wines: +10%
- Delivery delays (customs checks)

Mitigation:
- Source UK alternatives (when possible)
- Menu engineering (reduce import ingredients)
- Price increases (pass to customers)
```

## UK BI Opportunities

### 1. Sunday Roast Optimization

**Problem**:
- Sunday: £8,500 (+102%!)
- But: Prep-intensive, one day only
- How to maximize?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Sunday Roast Performance"
Track:
- Covers vs capacity (are we full?)
- Average spend (upsell desserts/drinks?)
- Prep efficiency (waste minimization)

Optimization:
- Pre-bookings (reduce no-shows, plan portions)
- Prix fixe only (no à la carte, kitchen efficiency)
- Upsell: "Add dessert £5" (50% take rate!)
```

---

### 2. Brexit Labor Cost Management

**Problem**:
- Labor: 35% → 42% (+20%!)
- Can't reduce quality (competition)
- Need creative solutions

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Labor Productivity Tracker"
Track:
- Revenue per labor hour
- Peak vs slow time staffing
- Table turnover rate (efficiency)

Strategy:
- Reduce operating days (Mon-Tue close)
- Dynamic scheduling (more staff peak, less slow)
- Technology: Order tablets (reduce server count)
- Cross-training (chef helps FOH when needed)
```
