## Miami Seasonal Dynamics

- Art Basel (December, art collectors)

Revenue:
Winter: $85k/month (+40% vs summer!)
Summer: $60k/month (locals only, hot)
Hurricane season (Aug-Oct): $50k/month (fear + actual)

Miami unique: Winter = HIGH season (vs Chicago winter = dead)
```

---

### Art Basel (December) - Revenue Explosion

**Art Basel Week Impact**:
```
Normal December Week: $18k
Art Basel Week: $65k (+261%!)

Why:
- 80,000 art collectors/celebrities descend
- Dinners $500-1,000/person
- Every reservation booked 2 months ahead
- Clubs charge $100 cover (vs normal $20)

Challenge:
- Staff shortage (need 2× staff for 1 week!)
- Inventory surge (triple orders!)
- Price gouging accusations (but everyone does it)
```

---

### Hurricane Season (August-October)

- Damage costs: $50k-200k
- Recovery: 2-3 months

Insurance:

```

## Miami Cultural F&B Practices

### Cuban Coffee Ritual

**Social Importance**:
```
Colada Culture:
- Shared pot (4-6 shots)
- Bring to office, share with coworkers
- Social bonding (not just caffeine!)

Cafecito Break:
- 10am, 3pm breaks (clockwork!)
- Standing at ventanita
- 5-10 minute chat
- Back to work

Business Implication:
- Ventanitas near offices = gold mine!
- Morning + afternoon peaks
```

---

### Late Dining (Latin American Hours)

**Dinner Timing**:
```
US Standard: 6-8pm
Miami: 9-11pm!

Why:
- Latin American culture (Spain, Argentina dine late)
- Hot days (wait til cooler evening)
- Nightlife starts after dinner (club at midnight!)

Restaurant Impact:
- Kitchen open til 1-2am
- Labor costs (late-night premium wages)
- But: Tables turn later (lose lunch → late dinner instead)
```

---

```
Staff Requirements:

- Kitchen: Often Spanish-only
- Menus: Bilingual English/Spanish

- But: Latin American tourists comfortable!
```
