## Seoul-Specific Operations

### Seoul Office Lunch Rush

Expectations:
- Order to table: <10 minutes

## Seoul Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Astronomical Rent (Gangnam Crisis)

**Problem**:
- Gangnam rent ₩25M-40M
- Need ₩1.5M daily just to cover rent!
- Slight revenue drop = immediate loss

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Rent Burden Watchdog"
Track:
- Daily revenue vs rent (target: rent <12%)
- Gangnam: Need ₩20M+ monthly revenue per ₩1M rent
- Alert: If trending below target 3 days in row

Recommendation:
- "Rent 18% → relocate or +₩5M revenue needed"
- "Lease ends 6 months → negotiate now or find alternative"
```

---

### 2. Delivery Dependency Risk

**Problem**:
- 60% revenue from delivery
- Baemin/Coupang control your business!
- Commission increase = profit wipe-out

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Delivery Dependency Tracker"
Track:
- Delivery % of total revenue
- Profit margin: dine-in vs delivery
- Platform mix (Baemin vs Coupang vs Yogiyo)

Risk Alert:
- ">70% delivery = platform risk too high"
- "Single platform >80% = negotiation weakness"

Strategy:
- Build own delivery (if volume justifies)
- Multi-platform presence (reduce dependency)
- Dine-in promotions (balance revenue mix)
```

---

### 3. Late-Night Labor Cost

**Problem**:
- Seoul 24/7 culture = 10pm-3am sales
- Late-night labor expensive (+50% wages!)
- Is it worth staying open?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Late-Night ROI Calculator"
Compare:
- 10pm-3am revenue
- Labor cost (night premium)
- Delivery only (no dine-in labor)

Analysis:
"11pm-3am generates ₩800k, costs ₩600k labor"
= ₩200k profit (25% margin)

But: Closing at 11pm saves ₩600k, loses ₩800k
Net: Better to stay open IF delivery-only (no servers!)
```

---

### 4. Weekend Dependency (Hongdae)

**Problem**:
- Friday-Saturday-Sunday = 60% weekly revenue
- Weekday slow (students in class, workers busy)
- Cash flow lumpy

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Weekday Optimization"
Track:
- Revenue by day (Mon-Thu vs Fri-Sun)
- Customer demographics (students vs workers)
- Promotional impact

Strategies:
- "Happy hour" 5-7pm weekdays (office workers after work)
- Student discounts Mon-Wed (fill slow days)
- Delivery focus weekdays (less dine-in, more delivery)
```
