## Jeju Tourism Impact

### Extreme Seasonality

**Tourist Arrivals by Month**:
```
January: 800k (winter, lowest)
February: 700k (coldest)
March: 1.1M (spring starts)
April: 1.4M (cherry blossoms!)
May: 1.5M (comfortable weather)
June: 1.6M (summer starts)
July: 2.1M (PEAK! families)
August: 2.0M (PEAK!)
September: 1.4M (still warm)
October: 1.3M (autumn)
November: 1M (cooling)
December: 900k (winter starts)

Annual: 15.8M
But: 43% in 3 months (June-Aug)!
```

**Revenue Implications**:
```
High Season Restaurant (June-Aug):
₩250M revenue/quarter

Low Season (Dec-Feb):
₩60M revenue/quarter (-76%!)

Cash Flow Challenge:
- Must save summer surplus: ₩80M-100M
- Cover 9 months of lower revenue
- Staff retention (seasonal unemployment)
```

---

### Chinese Tourist Dependency (Pre-COVID Legacy)

**Historical Context**:
```
2015-2016: Chinese tourists 40% of Jeju visitors!
- Direct flights from 20+ Chinese cities
- Visa-free entry (Jeju special status)
- Massive spending

2017: THAAD Crisis
- China banned group tours to Korea
- Jeju Chinese tourists -70%!
- Many restaurants/hotels closed

2020-2023: COVID
- All international tourists stopped
- Korean domestic only
- Shift to Korean tourist focus

2024-2026: Recovery
- Chinese slowly returning (15% of total)
- Jeju less dependent now (learned lesson!)
```

**BI Lesson**:
```
Dashboard: "Customer Origin Diversity"
Track:
- % from each source country
- Alert if any single source >30%

Risk:
"Chinese tourists = 35% of revenue → diversify!"
"Single source dependency = political risk"
```

## Jeju Operational Challenges

### 1. Island Logistics (Everything More Expensive)

**Transportation Cost**:
```
Supply Chain:
- Mainland → Jeju Ferry OR Air
- Ferry: 12 hours, cheaper but slower
- Air: 1 hour, faster but expensive

Examples:
- Beer case mainland: ₩25,000
- Beer case Jeju: ₩32,000 (+28%!)
- Vegetables +20-30%
- Meat +15-25%

Implication:
- Food cost 25-35% higher baseline
- Must charge premium (tourists accept)
- OR source locally (black pork, seafood, tangerines)
```

---

### 2. Labor Shortage (Island Population Small)

**Problem**:
```
Population: 670k only
Labor Pool:
- Mostly elderly (농民, farmers)
- Youth leave for Seoul jobs
- Hard to find restaurant staff

Seasonal Need:
- Summer: Need 2-3× staff
- Winter: Overstaffed

Solution:
- Hire mainland seasonal workers
- Housing provided (accommodation cost!)
- Higher wages to attract: +20-30% vs mainland
```

**Economics Impact**:
```
Labor Cost:
- Mainland Seoul: 25% of revenue
- Jeju (with housing): 30-32% of revenue

Housing:
- ₩500k-800k/month per worker
- 5 seasonal staff = ₩2.5M-4M/month extra cost!
```

---

### 3. Weather Dependency (Typhoons!)

**Problem**:
```
Typhoon Season: Aug-Oct
- Flights canceled
- Tourists stranded OR can't arrive
- Revenue instant drop

Impact:
- Typhoon week: -80-90% revenue
- 2-3 typhoons/year average
- Unpredictable

Example:
August 2023: Typhoon Khanun
- 5 days flights canceled
- ₩40M revenue lost (black pork restaurant)
- Cannot recover (tourists don't "make up" later)
```

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Weather Risk Tracker"
Typhoon Forecast:
- Track 7-day forecast
- Historical typhoon patterns (Aug-Oct high risk)
- Insurance options

Inventory Management:
- "Typhoon forecast 3 days out → reduce fresh orders"
- "Freeze extra meat (lasts 3-6 months)"

Financial Planning:
- Set aside ₩10M-20M/year for typhoon loss
- Diversify revenue (delivery to locals even if tourists gone)
```

---

## Jeju Opportunities

### 1. Korean "Workation" Trend (2024-2026)

**New Phenomenon**:
```
Remote Work + Vacation:
- COVID normalized WFH
- Koreans work from Jeju for weeks/months
- "Digital nomad" Koreans
- NOT tourists (longer stay!)

Impact on F&B:
- Weekday lunch demand (previously only weekends)
- Repeat customers (build loyalty)
- Less seasonal (work year-round)

Workation Customer:
- Average stay: 2-4 weeks
- Spend: ₩30k-50k/day on food
- Value quality + comfort (not tourist rush)
```

**Restaurant Strategy**:
```
Workation-Friendly:
- WiFi essential (fast, stable)
- Power outlets at tables
- Quiet atmosphere (vs loud tourist groups)
- Set meals (₩10k-12k lunch, predictable)
- Loyalty card (repeat visits!)

Revenue Smoothing:
- Summer: Tourists 80%, Workation 20%
- Winter: Tourists 40%, Workation 60%!
- Reduces seasonality volatility
```
