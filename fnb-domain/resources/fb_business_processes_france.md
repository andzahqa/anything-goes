```

---

### CDI Contracts (Can't Fire!)

**Problem**:
```
CDI (Permanent Contract):
- After 6 months, very hard to fire
- Severance: 1 month salary per year worked!
- 10-year employee = 10 months severance

Impact:
- Careful hiring (stuck with bad employee!)
- Seasonal restaurants struggle (can't lay off winter)
```

---

## Terroir Philosophy

```
Protected Designations:

- Bresse chicken (specific breed, area)
- Bordeaux wine (Bordeaux region)

Menu Requirements:
- Must state origin: "Boeuf de Charolais" (Charolais beef)
- Customers care deeply
- Fake origin = scandal + fines!
```

## France Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Labor Cost Burden

**Problem**:
- 40% of revenue = labor (vs US 30%)

- 35-hour week limits productivity

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Labor Productivity Optimizer"
Track:
- Revenue per labor hour
- Peak vs slow times (optimize scheduling)
- CDI vs CDD contracts (temporary)

Strategy:
- Core staff: CDI (permanent, protected)
- Peak times: CDD (temporary, easier to end)
- Students: Part-time (more flexible rules)
```

---

### 2. Tourist vs Local Pricing

**Problem**:
- Tourists pay €7 espresso (Champs-Élysées)
- Locals pay €1.50 (neighborhood)
- Same city, 5× price difference!

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Location Premium Tracker"
Track:
- Revenue by location tier
- Tourist % (credit card country of origin)
- Local loyalty (repeat customers)

Finding:
- Champs-Élysées: €7 coffee, 95% tourists,low repeat
- Marais: €3.50 coffee, 60% locals, high repeat

Strategy:
- Tourist areas: Premium pricing (they expect it!)
- Local areas: Fair pricing (loyalty builds revenue)
```
