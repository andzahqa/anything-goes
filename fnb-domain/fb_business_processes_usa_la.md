## LA Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Car Culture (Parking Dependency)

**Problem**:
- LA = Drive everywhere
- No parking = won't visit!
- Valet parking expensive ($10-15 customer pays)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Parking Impact Tracker"
Track:
- Revenue on "easy parking" days vs "hard parking" days
- Valet usage % (are customers paying or leaving?)
- Nearby event correlation (concerts = parking nightmare)

Findings:
- Grammy Awards nearby: -35% revenue (parking impossible!)
- New city parking structure opens: +18% revenue

Strategy:
- Validate parking (restaurant pays $3, customer free)
- ROI: $3 cost → retain $75 customer
```

---

### 2. Celebrity Trend Volatility

**Problem**:
- Celebrity endorsement = +200% bookings
- Celebrity stops coming = -50% next month
- Impossible to predict

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Celebrity Influence Tracker"
Track:
- Social media mentions (Instagram, Twitter)
- Paparazzi sightings (documented visits)
- Booking spikes after celeb post

Plan:
- Don't count on celebrity buzz (temporary!)
- Build regular customer base (sustainable)
- Track: Repeat customer % (target >30%)
```

---

### 3. Food Truck Permit Maze

**Problem**:
- LA: Different permits for each city (LA, Santa Monica, Culver City, etc.)
- Health permits, parking permits, fire permits
- $5,000-10,000/year total permits!

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Permit ROI by Location"
Track:
- Revenue by city/location
- Permit cost allocated
- Net profit after permits

Example:
- Santa Monica permit: $2,500/year
- SM revenue: $8,000/month = $96k/year
- Worth it!

- Culver City permit: $1,800/year
- CC revenue: $2,500/month = $30k/year
- Maybe not worth vs other locations
```
