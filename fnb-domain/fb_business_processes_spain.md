```

**Standard Menú del Día**:
```
Price: €12-18 (incredible value!)

- Starter (salad, soup, or appetizer)
- Main (3-4 options: fish, meat, paella)
- Dessert (fruit, flan, ice cream)

### 3. Pintxos (Basque Tapas)

**What is it**: Toothpick tapas, count sticks for bill

**Basque Pintxos** (San Sebastián style):
```
System:
- Pintxos on counter (pre-made)
- Customer takes which they want
- Bartender counts toothpicks at end
- Honor system (mostly!)

Pricing: €2.50-5 per pintxo

Famous San Sebastián:
- 100+ pintxos bars in old town
- Bar hopping culture (1-2 at each bar)
- Tourism driving prices up
```

---

### 4. Paella (Lunch ONLY!)

**Important Rule**:
```
Paella = Lunch dish (never dinner!)
- Valencian tradition: Heavy rice lunch
- Dinner = lighter tapas

Tourist Mistake:
- Ordering paella 9pm dinner
- Locals know it's wrong
- But: Tourist restaurants serve it (money!)

Authentic:
- Paella made fresh (30-40 min cook!)
- Minimum 2 people (can't make single portion)
- Sundays = paella day (family tradition)
```

### Summer Tourism Explosion

- Packed 1pm-2am

Winter (Oct-May):
- Locals only
- Revenue: €48k/month (60% drop!)
- Many coastal restaurants CLOSE entirely Nov-March

Cash Flow:
- Must save summer €70k surplus
- Cover winter 5-month shortfall
- Seasonal staff (hire May, fire October)
```

## Spain Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Late Dining Labor Costs

**Problem**:
- Dinner peak: 10pm-midnight
- Kitchen staff til 1-2am (cleanup)
- Night shift premium: +20-30% wages

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Late Night Profitability"
Track:
- Revenue 10pm-1am vs labor cost
- Customer count by hour
- Margin: late vs normal hours

Finding:
- 10pm-12am: 40% of daily revenue (worth it!)
- 12am-1am: 8% of revenue, 15% of labor (not worth it?)

Strategy:
- Kitchen closes 12:30am (vs 1:30am)
- Last seating 11:30pm (not midnight)
- Save 2 hours labor × €60 = €120/night = €3,120/month
```

---

### 2. Summer Tourism Dependency

**Problem**:
- Summer: €120k/month
- Winter: €48k/month
- Coastal restaurants live/die on 4 summer months

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Seasonal Cash Reserve Planning"
Track:
- Summer surplus: €70k × 4 months = €280k
- Winter shortfall: -€20k × 5 months = -€100k
- Required reserve: €100k minimum

Strategy:
- Save €100k from summer (don't spend!)
- Reduce winter hours (Tue-Wed close)
- Winter menu simplified (lower costs)
- Or: Close entirely Dec-Feb (some do this!)
```

---

### 3. Menú del Día Profitability

**Problem**:
- Menú del día: €15, margin 23% (low!)
- But brings in lunch crowd
- Does it pay off?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Menú del Día ROI Tracker"
Track:
- Lunch customers who return for dinner
- Customer lifetime value
- Lunch-only vs lunch+dinner customers

Finding:
- 30% of menú customers return for dinner later!
- Lifetime value: €15 lunch + (€35 dinner × 0.3) = €25.50 avg
- Margin on €25.50: 35% (vs 23% lunch-only)

Verdict: Keep menú del día (builds loyalty!)
```
