## New Orleans Seasonal Dynamics

### Mardi Gras (February) - Insanity!

**Mardi Gras Impact**:
```
Normal Month: $85k revenue
Mardi Gras Month: $350k revenue (+312%!)

Why:
- 1.4M visitors (parade season, 2 weeks)
- Hotels $500/night (vs $150 normal)
- Restaurants packed 18 hours/day
- Bars 24/7 crush

Challenges:
- Staff shortage (can't find enough workers!)
- Supply chain (run out of food mid-week!)
- Exhaustion (staff work 14-hour days, 14 days straight)

Strategy:
- Hire temp staff (seasonal)
- Pre-order extra inventory (2-3× normal)
- Price surge (+30-50% during Mardi Gras!)
- Cash flow: Save Mardi Gras windfall for slow months
```

---

### Hurricane Season (August-October) - Fear

**Hurricane Impact**:
```
Hurricane Warning:
- Tourists cancelreservations
- Flights canceled
- Revenue: -70-90% for warning week
- Even if hurricane misses!

Hurricane Katrina (2005):
- 80% of restaurants closed permanently
- Trauma lingers (customers still nervous)

Modern Preparation:
- Hurricane insurance (expensive: $8k-15k/year!)
- Emergency supplies stocked
- Evacuation plan
- Accept: 2-3 zero-revenue weeks/year

August-October Revenue:
- Good year: $75k/month
- Hurricane scare year: $40k/month
- Direct hit (rare): $0 + damage costs
```

---

## New Orleans Tourism Dependency

**75%+ Customers = Tourists**:
```
Tourist Characteristics:
- First-time visitors (don't know quality vs tourist trap)
- Short stay (2-3 days average)
- "Experience" oriented (pay premium for ambiance)
- French Quarter focused (ignore better local spots)

Impact:
- Can charge +40% in French Quarter (tourists don't know)
- But: No repeat business (one-time customers)
- Quality can slip (tourists won't come back anyway)

Strategy Divide:
French Quarter: Tourist pricing, lower quality okay
Uptown/Bywater: Local pricing, quality essential (locals return!)
```

## New Orleans Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Mardi Gras Cash Flow Planning

**Problem**:
- Feb Mardi Gras: $350k revenue
- March-July: $70k/month average
- Must save Mardi Gras windfall to survive slow months

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Mardi Gras Surplus Allocation"
Track:
- Mardi Gras revenue vs normal
- Surplus: $350k - $85k normal = $265k extra
- Slow months need: April-July × $15k shortfall = $60k reserve

Plan:
- Save $60k+ from Mardi Gras for slow months
- Pay off debt (credit card from Hurricane insurance)
- Equipment upgrades (new fryer, replace worn)
- Staff bonuses (worked 14-hour days!)

Alert:
- "Spent $200k of $265k Mardi Gras surplus → only $65k left for 5 slow months!"
```

---

### 2. Hurricane Revenue Loss Planning

**Problem**:
- 2-3 weeks zero revenue when hurricane threatens
- Insurance covers damage but NOT lost revenue
- Can't predict which year

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Hurricane Season Reserve Tracker"
Track:
- Historical hurricane frequency (every 2-3 years impact)
- Lost revenue: Average $50k-80k per event
- Insurance deductible: $10k

Reserve Target:
- Set aside: $100k/year for hurricanes
- Build over 12 months: $8,300/month
- When hurricane hits: Tap reserve (don't panic borrow!)

Recovery Plan:
- Re-open immediately after (locals return support!)
- "We're back!" marketing
- Temporarily extend hours (make up lost revenue)
```

---

### 3. Tourist vs Local Balance

**Problem**:
- French Quarter: 95% tourists (high margin but no loyalty)
- Uptown: 70% locals (lower margin but repeat business)
- Which to optimize for?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Customer Loyalty vs Margin Tracker"
Compare:
French Quarter:
- Average: $55/person
- Margin: 38%
- Repeat rate: 2% (almost never return!)
- Revenue consistency: Volatile (tourism dependent)

Uptown:
- Average: $35/person
- Margin: 28%
- Repeat rate: 45% (loyal base!)
- Revenue consistency: Stable

Insight:
- French Quarter for Mardi Gras/peak (capture tourist surge)
- Uptown for year-round stability (locals sustain in slow months)
- Diversified portfolio = risk reduction
```
