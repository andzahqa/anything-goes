## Challenges & BI Solutions

### Vietnam F&B Pain Points

#### 1. Weather Dependency (Street Vendors)

**Problem**:
- Rain = no customers (everyone stays inside)
- Losing ₫3M-6M on rainy days
- Already bought fresh ingredients

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Weather-Adjusted Revenue Forecast"
Track:
- Historical revenue on rainy vs sunny days
- 7-day weather forecast integration
- Ingredient ordering adjustment

Recommendation:
- "Tomorrow 80% rain chance → order 40% less ingredients"
- "Rainy season average: ₫3.2M vs dry ₫5.8M"

Result: Reduce waste, optimize purchasing
```

---

#### 2. Wet Market Price Fluctuations

**Problem**:
- Beef ₫250k/kg yesterday, ₫350k today (+40%!)
- Heavy rain = vegetable prices spike
- Can't change menu prices daily (customer backlash)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Ingredient Price Tracker"
Track:
- Daily wet market spend per ingredient
- Historical price trends (30/60/90 days)
- Seasonal patterns

Alerts:
- "Beef price up 35% today → switch to chicken promotion?"
- "Herb prices high → reduce garnish portions?"

Help:
- Menu optimization (which dishes to push based on margins)
- Alert when prices spike >25%
```

---

#### 3. Peak Hour Capacity (Pho Vendor)

**Problem**:
- 7:30-9am = 60% of daily revenue in 90 minutes
- Long queue = customers leave
- Can't cook faster than 5 bowls/10 min

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Peak Hour Optimization"
Analyze:
- Orders by 15-min blocks
- Queue abandonment estimate
- Revenue lost to capacity constraints

Recommendations:
- "Lost ₫800k/day due to queue → ROI of helper: 250%"
- "Pre-cook broth portions in serving containers"
- "Prep 80% of components before peak"
```

---

#### 4. Location Optimization (Mobile Vendors)

**Problem**:
- Banh mi cart: Which spot makes most money?
- Morning near office vs school vs market?
- Time to move between locations costs revenue

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Location-Time Revenue Matrix"
Compare:
- Monday 7am @ Office Building = ₫450k
- Monday 7am @ School = ₫280k
- Monday 11:30am @ University = ₫520k

Include:
- Travel time between spots
- Setup time
- Competition at each location

Output: Optimal daily route schedule
```

---

#### 5. E-Wallet Adoption ROI

**Problem**:
- Should I invest time to setup Momo/ZaloPay?
- Promotions eat into margins (20% off!)
- Is it worth it?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Digital Payment Impact Analysis"
Track:
- Cash vs e-wallet transaction %
- Average bill by payment method (e-wallet users spend more?)
- Customer demographics
- Promo cost vs new customer acquisition

Finding Example:
- E-wallet customers spend +18% more per transaction
- Younger demographic (18-35) = 75% e-wallet preference
- Promo cost: ₫800k/month
- New revenue from e-wallet customers: ₫2.8M/month
- ROI: 250%

Recommendation: Adopt e-wallet, worth it!
```
