   - Shorter hours (8pm close vs 10pm summer)

4. Super Bowl / Playoffs:
   - Sports viewership peaks winter
   - Super Bowl Sunday = +200% revenue!
   - March Madness = steady March boost

## Chicago Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Winter Revenue Crash

**Problem**:
- Summer $$65k, Winter $35k (-46%!)
- Still pay full rent ($10k/month)
- Staff retention (can't fire/rehire seasonally)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Winter Survival Planner"
Track:
- Historical summer vs winter revenue (by month)
- Cash reserve needed (winter×months × burn rate)
- Seasonal menu adjustments (comfort food)

Plan:
- "Save $30k from summer for winter shortfall"
- "Winter menu: Add 3 stew dishes (48% margin, comfort food)"
- "Close Mon-Tue Dec-Feb (save $8k/month labor)"
```

---

### 2. Sports Event Correlation

**Problem**:
- Cubs win → bars packed, restaurants slow!
- Bears game (home) → pre-game surge, during-game dead
- Blackhawks playoffs → unpredictable spikes

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Sports Calendar Revenue Predictor"
Track:
- Revenue on game days vs non-game days
- Pre-game (2-4pm) vs during-game (7-10pm)
- Playoffs (longer season) vs regular

Findings:
- Cubs home game: -25% dinner revenue (fans at game!)
- Cubs away game (on TV): +35% bar/tavern revenue
- Super Bowl Sunday: +180% (everyone orders in!)

Strategy:
- Game day specials (watch party at restaurant)
- Delivery focus during game (people at home watching)
- Pre-game prix fixe (rush service 2-4pm)
```

---

### 3. Neighborhood Cannibalization

**Problem**:
- Open 2nd location in different neighborhood
- Original location revenue -15% (customers switched!)
- Total revenue not 2×

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Multi-Location Cannibalization Tracker"
Track:
- Customer zip codes (credit card data)
- Original location revenue after new location opens
- New location customer origin (from original or new base?)

Finding:
- Original (Logan Square): $55k → $47k after Wicker Park opens
- Wicker Park: $38k
- Total: $85k (not $55k×2=$110k)
- Cannibalization: 30%!

Strategy:
- Open far away (different neighborhoods, 5+ miles)
- OR different concept (pizza vs burgers)
```
