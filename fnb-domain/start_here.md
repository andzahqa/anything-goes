This comprehensive guide teaches you how Food & Beverage businesses actually work.

## Why This Matters

**You can't build good BI dashboards without understanding the business.**

This guide covers:
- ✅ 6 F&B business models (QSR, Fast Casual, Full Service, Fine Dining, Cafe, Cloud Kitchen)
- ✅ Front of House operations (servers, hosts, bartenders)
- ✅ Back of House operations (kitchen, prep, cooking)
- ✅ Supply chain & inventory management
- ✅ Financial processes and metrics
- ✅ Technology systems (POS, inventory, etc.)
- ✅ Daily/weekly/monthly workflows
- ✅ Common pain points and how BI helps

## How to Use This

### Option 1: Read Before Starting BI
**Best for**: Understanding context first
- **Time**: 3-4 hours to read fully
- **Benefit**: You'll know why certain metrics matter

### Option 2: Read Alongside BI Learning
**Best for**: Just-in-time learning
- Read sections as you need them
- Example: Read "F&B Metrics" when you start calculating KPIs

### Option 3: Skim Now, Deep Dive Later
**Best for**: Getting started quickly (Recommended!)
- **Today**: Spend 30 minutes skimming the overview
- **Later**: Deep read before Phase 5 (F&B Specialization)

## First Steps

**Right now** (30 minutes):
1. Open [fb_business_processes.md](fb_business_processes.md)
2. Read: "F&B Business Overview" section
3. Pick one business model you're familiar with (or interested in)
4. Read that section in detail
5. Think: What data does this business generate?

**This week**:
1. Visit a restaurant and observe with new eyes:
   - How do orders flow from customer → kitchen → table?
   - What technology are they using?
   - What problems might they have?
2. Write down 10 questions their owner might want answered
3. Sketch a concept: What dashboard would help them most?

## Practice Datasets

**Available**:
- `datasets/menu_items.csv` - Sample menu with costs and prices

**What You Can Do**:
- Calculate food cost % by category
- Find most profitable items
- Analyze pricing strategy

**To Create** (see datasets/README.md):
- Sample transaction data
- Inventory data
- Labor/employee data

## Key F&B Metrics to Know

**Financial**:
- Food Cost % = (COGS / Food Sales) × 100
- Labor Cost % = (Labor / Sales) × 100
- Prime Cost % = (COGS + Labor) / Sales × 100 (Target: <60%)

**Operational**:
- Table Turnover Rate
- Average Check Size
- RevPASH (Revenue Per Available Seat Hour)

**All detailed in the main guide!**
