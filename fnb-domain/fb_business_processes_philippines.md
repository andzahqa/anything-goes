## Challenges & BI Solutions

### Philippines F&B Pain Points

#### 1. Typhoon/Weather Dependency

**Problem**:
- Typhoon = zero revenue day
- 5-10 days/year completely wasted
- Can't plan, erratic weather

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Weather Impact Tracker"
Track:
- Revenue on rainy vs sunny days
- Typhoon season patterns (June-Nov worse)
- PAGASA (weather agency) forecast integration
- Ingredient purchasing adjustments

Recommendation:
- "Typhoon Ompong forecasted this week → order 30% less"
- "Build cash reserve: ₱15,000 for 3 zero-revenue days"

Risk Planning: Set aside 10% monthly profit for weather buffer
```

---

#### 2. Lunch Hour Concentration

**Problem**:
- 60% revenue in 2 hours (11am-1pm)
- Can't serve everyone (queue too long)
- Lost sales due to capacity

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Lunch Rush Optimizer"
Analyze:
- Orders by 10-minute blocks
- Queue abandonment (people leave if queue too long)
- Viand sell-out times

Recommendations:
- "Adobo sold out by 12:15pm = lost sales of ₱800"
- "Prep 20% more for top 3 viands"
- "ROI of hiring lunch-hour helper: 180%"
```

---

#### 3. Palengke Price Volatility

**Problem**:
- Chicken ₱180/kg yesterday, ₱250/kg today
- Typhoon = vegetables 2× expensive
- Can't raise menu prices daily (customeranger)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Ingredient Cost Tracker"
Track:
- Daily market spending per ingredient
- Price spike alerts (>20% increase)
- Alternative ingredient suggestions

Smart Menu:
- Chicken expensive? → Push vegetable viands today
- Tomatoes ₱200/kg? → Skip menudo, do other dishes
- Fish normal price? → Feature fish viands
```

---

#### 4. GCash Adoption ROI

**Problem**:
- Should I accept GCash?
- Lose customers who don't carry cash?
- Is it worth setting up?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Digital Payment Impact"
Compare:
- Neighboring carinderias with GCash vs without
- Customer demographic (young = digital preference)
- Lost sales estimate (millennials avoid cash-only)

Findings:
- Setup cost: ₱0 (free GCash QR)
- Transaction fee: 0% (GCash to GCash free)
- Potential revenue increase: +12-18% (attract digital customers)
- Millennial customers: 75% prefer digital

Recommendation: Adopt GCash, zero downside!
```

---

#### 5. Merienda Time Optimization

**Problem**:
- Is it worth staying open for merienda (3-5pm)?
- Or close after lunch 2pm, re-open 5pm dinner?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Daypart Profitability"
Compare:
- Merienda Revenue: ₱800-1,500
- Labor cost for those hours: ₱200
- Ingredients: ₱400-600
- Net: ₱200-700

BUT:
- Keep kitchen warm (no re-heating)
- Catch early dinner customers (5-6pm)
- Regular customer retention

Analysis: Worth staying open if merienda makes >₱500/day
```
