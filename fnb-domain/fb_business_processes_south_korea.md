## Korean F&B Regulations

### NoShow Penalties

**Reservation Deposit System**:
```
Problem: Korean "NoShow" culture was terrible
- 20-30% no-show rate (pre-2020)
- Restaurants losing massive revenue

Solution (2020+):
- Kakao/Naver reservation requires card
- ₩10,000-20,000/person deposit
- NoShow = charged

Impact:
- NoShow rate dropped to <5%!
- Restaurants can plan better
- Customer commitment increased

BI Insight:
- Track NoShow rate by platform
- Cancellation window (24hr vs 12hr vs 6hr)
- Optimal deposit (too low = still no-show, too high = less bookings)
```
