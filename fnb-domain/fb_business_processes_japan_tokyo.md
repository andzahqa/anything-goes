## Tokyo Neighborhoods (F&B Districts)

### Tsukiji / Toyosu (Fish Market Area)

**Background**:
- **Old Tsukiji Market**: Moved to Toyosu 2018

Morning-only: 5am-11am (6 hours)
Covers: 80-120 (high turnover, standing/counter only)
Average: ¥4,500
Daily: ¥360k-540k
Monthly (26 days): ¥9.4M-14M

Food Cost: 45% (premium fish from auction!)
Labor: 20% (short hours, concentrated)
Rent: ¥1.2M-1.8M (tourist location premium)
Net: 20-25%
```

= High turnover ESSENTIAL

Strategy: Volume over margin
- Gyudon: ¥500, 400 bowls/day = ¥200k

```
Timing:
3:00am - Tuna auction (bluefin can go ¥1M+!)
4:00am - General fish auction
5:00am - Restaurants start purchasing

Quality Grades:
Top Grade (特上): Restaurant-quality

  - Salmon roe (ikura): ¥6,000-10,000/kg

```

---

### Tokyo Commuter Patterns (Business Impact)

**Rush Hour Dynamics**:
```
Morning (7-9am):
- Station concourse bakeries: 200% spike
- Standing soba/udon: Quick breakfast
- Konbini: Onigiri grab-and-go

Lunch (11:30am-1:30pm):
- Office district ramen: 4-5 turns (60 min wait!)
- Gyudon chains: 6-8 turns
- Bento takeaway: Huge spike

Dinner (6-8pm):
- Izakaya: Peak starts
- Ramen (post-drinking): 9pm-12am
- Late-night gyudon: 11pm-2am (drunk salary men!)
```

**BI Opportunity**: Track train line schedules
```
Last train: 12:30am
→ 11:30pm-12:30am spike (people rushing home)
→ Post-midnight drop (only night shift workers)

Friday/Saturday:
→ All-night restaurants stay busy (people miss last train intentionally!)
```

## Tokyo Technology Leadership

### Cashless Adoption (Higher than Japan Average)

**Tokyo Digital Payment**:
```
Cash: 60% (vs 70% national)
PayPay: 20%
Suica/Pasmo: 15% (train IC cards!)
Credit Card: 5%

Why Higher:
- Younger demographic
- More foreign tourists (cash-only = inconvenient)
- Corporate expenses (cards preferred for receipts)
```

---

### Automation Leaders

**Robot Server Pilots**:
```
Pepper Robot (SoftBank):
- Tested in 100+ Tokyo restaurants 2024-2025
- Greets customers, explains menu
- Limited success (customers prefer human interaction)

Delivery Robots:
- Autonomous delivery bots in Roppongi
- Navigate sidewalks, elevator-capable
- More PR stunt than practical (yet)

Touch Screen Tablets:
- 80% of izakaya chains (vs 40% national)
- Order drinks/food without calling staff
```

**Ticket Vending Machine Evolution**:
```
Traditional:
- Insert cash → select button → receive ticket

Modern (Tokyo-first):
- Touch screen with photos
- PayPay/Suica payment
- English/Chinese/Korean language options
- Allergy filtering (gluten-free, vegetarian)
- Nutritional info display
```

---

## Tokyo Financial Benchmarks

### Rent as % of Revenue (Critical!)

**Tokyo Rent Burden**:
```
Ginza/Roppongi: 15-25% (vs 8-12% national target!)
Shibuya/Sh injuku: 12-18%
Residential areas: 8-12%

Impact on Pricing:
- Must charge 30% more to maintain margins
- OR increase turnover (standing-only, no chairs)
- OR niche premium (Michelin justifies high prices)

Break-Even Example (Shibuya):
Rent: ¥1.8M/month
Target Rent %: 15%
Needed Revenue: ¥1.8M ÷ 0.15 = ¥12M/month
= ¥400,000/day (26 days)
= 400 customers × ¥1,000 OR 200 × ¥2,000

Strategy: Volume (gyudon) or Premium (kaiseki)
```

---

### Labor Cost (Tokyo Premium)

**Tokyo Wages**:
```
Minimum Wage: ¥1,150/hr (2026)
vs National average: ¥950-1,050/hr

Part-time Staff:
- Kitchen: ¥1,200-1,400/hr
- Server: ¥1,150-1,300/hr
- Chef (full-time): ¥280,000-350,000/month

Labor Shortage Impact:
- Raising wages 5-8% yearly
- Restaurants closing due to no staff
- Automation investment ROI improving
```

## Tokyo Challenges & BI Solutions

### 1. Extreme Rent Pressure

**Problem**:
- Ginza rent ¥3M/month = need ¥100k daily revenue
- Slight revenue drop = immediate loss
- Lease renewals = 10-20% rent increases

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Rent-to-Revenue Watchdog"
Track:
- Daily revenue vs rent obligation
- "Days needed to cover rent" (target: <10 days)
- Renewal timeline alerts (6 months ahead)

Optimization:
- "Current rent 18% → need +15% revenue or relocate"
- "Lease renewal in 4 months → negotiate now or find backup"
```

---

### 2. Commuter Dependency

**Problem**:
- 60% revenue during lunch rush (11:30am-1pm)
- COVID showed risk: Work-from-home = -40% lunch revenue
- Typhoons/trains停 = zero revenue

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Commuter Traffic Correlator"
Track:
- Train ridership data (JR East publishes)
- Weather forecast
- Holiday calendar (Golden Week, O-Bon)

Predictions:
- "Typhoon tomorrow → prep 30% less ingredients"
- "3-day weekend → 50% less lunch Mon-Tue"
- "Train strike → close for lunch, open dinner only"
```

---

### 3. Michelin Star Pressure

**Problem**:
- +1 star = +200% bookings, +30% prices
- -1 star = -60% bookings, shame
- Extreme stress on chefs (some commit suicide from pressure)

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Michelin Quality Consistency"
Track:
- Ingredient sourcing (supplier changes = risk)
- Dish execution time variance (consistency metric)
- Customer feedback sentiment (pre-inspector visit)
- Food cost % (maintain quality even if profit drops)

Alerts:
- "Fish supplier downgrade detected → quality risk!"
- "Execution time +25% variance → staff retraining needed"
- "Negative feedback spike → investigate before inspection"
```
