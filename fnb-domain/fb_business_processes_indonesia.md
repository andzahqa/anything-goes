- Popular iftar dishes
- Ingredient multiplier recommendations

Forecast:

```

---

- Price spike patterns (seasonal, weather)
- Alert when chicken >Rp 85k/kg

Menu Optimization:
- Chicken expensive? Push tempe/tahu dishes today

WhatsApp to regular customers:
- "Today's special: Ikan Nila Rp 18k (chicken price up)"
```

---

#### 4. Lunch Hour Capacity

**Problem**:
- 11:30am-1pm = 60% of daily revenue (90 minutes!)
- Long queue = customers leave
- Can't cook faster

**BI Solution**:

- "Lost revenue estimate: Rp 300k/day due to capacity"
- "ROI of lunch helper: 220%"

Pre-Order System:
- WhatsApp pre-orders 1 hour ahead

```

---

#### 5. Regional Pricing Strategy

**Problem**:

- What prices for each location?

**BI Solution**:
```

- Yogyakarta rent: Rp 3M, wages: Rp 2.5M, spending: Rp 20k
- Medan rent: Rp 4M, wages: Rp 3M, spending: Rp 25k
