## Supply Chain & Inventory Management

### Indonesian Supply Chain Models

**Traditional Warung**:
```
Daily Sourcing (Pasar Tradisional):

Morning routine:
1. Wake 4am
2. Go to pasar 4:30am
3. Shop 5am-6:30am
4. Return with ingredients
5. Cook same day (ultra-fresh!)

Advantages:
- Freshest ingredients daily
- No inventory waste (cook what you buy)
- Cash flow simple (buy today, sell today)
- Flexibility (adjust menu based on price/availability)

Disadvantages:
- No bulk discounts
- Price volatility (pasar prices change daily!)
- Labor intensive (daily market trips)
- Weather dependent (rain = higher prices)

Inventory: Minimal!
- Rice: 3-4 days supply (25kg sack)
- Oil, salt, spices: Weekly purchase
- Fresh food: Zero inventory (daily purchase)
```

**Modern Chain Restaurant**:
```
Centralized Sourcing:

Supply Chain:
1. Central Warehouse (Jakarta, Surabaya)
2. Bulk purchasing from suppliers
3. Daily/weekly delivery to outlets
4. Standardized portions

Example (Solaria):
- Supplier contracts (chicken, vegetables)
- Predictable pricing (less volatility)
- Quality control at warehouse
- Distribution trucks to 150+ outlets

Inventory Management:
- 3-7 days stock on-site
- PAR levels (minimum inventory)
- Automated reorder (POS integrated)
- FIFO (First In First Out)

Cost Savings:
- Bulk discount: 15-25% vs pasar
- Labor savings: No daily market trips
- Waste reduction: Better forecasting
- Standardization: Consistent quality

Trade-off:
- Less fresh (2-5 days old vs same-day)
- Acceptable for chain (customers expect consistency, not ultra-fresh)
```

---

### Inventory Challenges (Indonesia-Specific)

**1. Pasar Price Volatility**:
```
Example - Chicken prices:
Mon: Rp 36,000/kg
Tue: Rp 42,000/kg (+17%!)
Wed: Rp 38,000/kg

Why:
- Weather (rain = supply chain disruption)
- Religion (Friday prayer day, less supply)
- Seasonality (Ramadan = spike)

Warung Response:
- Adjust menu prices daily (flexible!)
- OR: Accept lower margin
- OR: Substitute (use tempe instead of chicken)

Chain Response:
- Supplier contracts (lock in price)
- Absorb volatility (stable menu prices)
```

**2. Ramadan Inventory Surge**:
```
Normal Month: Rp 350k ingredients/day
Ramadan: Rp 550k ingredients/day (+57%!)

Buka Puasa Rush (6pm):
- Need 2× normal stock
- Risk: If under-order = sold out (lost revenue!)
- Risk: If over-order = waste (food can't hold overnight)

Smart Planning:
- Historical data (last year's Ramadan)
- Daily adjustments (Day 1 sold out? Order more Day 2)
```

---

---

- "Selamat malam, silakan duduk" (greeting)

- Complaints handled immediately

Cultural Notes:
- Indonesians avoid confrontation
- Won't complain directly (just won't return!)
- Good service = quiet, efficient, respectful
- Over-friendly can be seen as pushy (vs USA where it's encouraged)
```

---

## Staff Management (Indonesian Labor Market)

### Hiring & Training

**Labor Market Reality**:
```
Challenges:
- High turnover (30-40% annually!)
- Young workforce (18-25 years, first job)
- Limited formal training (learn on job)
- Low English proficiency (outside Jakarta)

Typical Background:
- High school graduate (SMA)
- Village to city migration (cari kerja = find work)
- Lives in kost (boarding house, Rp 800k-1.5M/month)
- Sends money home to family (remittances)

Warung Hiring:
- Family first! (nephew, cousin)
- Word of mouth (neighbor's daughter)

Modern Restaurant Hiring:

```

### Labor Costs & Regulations

Surabaya: Rp 4,783,000/month
Bandung: Rp 3,925,000/month

- Entry-level: Rp 3M-4M (below UMR often!)
- Mid-level: Rp 4.5M-6M

```

**BPJS (National Health Insurance)**:
```

Total cost: Rp 4.16M

Warung Reality:
- Often don't provide (informal)
- Employee must buy own (Rp 42k-100k/month individual)

Chain Compliance:
- Must provide or face fines
- Adds 4-5% to labor costs
```

---

### Staff Retention Challenges

**High Turnover (30-40% annually)**:
```
Why Staff Leave:
1. Better pay elsewhere (+Rp 500k = reason to switch!)
2. Marriage (women often stop working)
3. Return to village (family obligations)
4. Better opportunities (office job > F&B)
5. Burnout (long hours, weekend work)

Retention Tactics:
- Meal benefits (huge savings for workers)
- Bonus system (Ramadan bonus = 1 month salary)
- Fair scheduling (predictable hours)
- Promotion path (server → shift leader → manager)
- Family atmosphere (staff = keluarga)

Cost of Turnover:
- Recruiting: Rp 500k-1M
- Training: 2 weeks lost productivity
- Mistakes during learning: Rp 1M-2M revenue impact
- Total: Rp 3M-5M per replacement!
```

---

## Technology Systems (Indonesian F&B)

```
System: Paper + Memory!
- Orders: Written on scrap paper

Works because:
- Simple menu (10-15 items)

```

**Modern - POS Adoption**:

### Delivery Platform Integration

**GoFood/GrabFood Integration**:
```
How it Works:
1. Customer orders on app
2. Order sent to restaurant tablet
3. Restaurant confirms (2 min response time!)
4. Kitchen prepares
5. Driver picks up
6. Delivery to customer

Restaurant Tablet:
- Provided by GoFood/Grab (free!)
- Buzzes when order comes
- Must confirm quickly (or auto-reject)

Integration with POS:
- Advanced: Tablet → POS automatic
- Basic: Manual entry (staff types into POS)

Commission: 20-25% of order
Payment: Weekly transfer to bank
```

---

### Kitchen Display Systems (KDS)

**Modern Chain Restaurants**:
```
Setup:
- Monitor in kitchen shows orders
- Color-coded by time (red = overdue!)
- Bump when complete

Benefits:
- No lost paper orders
- Order priority clear
- Timing visible (rush orders red!)
- Efficiency +15-20%

Cost:
- Screen: Rp 3M-5M
- Software: Included in POS

Warung Reality:
- Too expensive for Rp 60M/month revenue
- Owner shouts orders (works fine!)
```

---

## Halal Requirements

### Critical Market Factor

**87% Muslim Population**:
```
Halal is NOT optional - it's ESSENTIAL
95%+ of F&B must be halal-compliant
```

**Halal Certification Levels**:

**MUI Certified** (Majelis Ulama Indonesia):
```
Gold Standard:
- Official halal certification body
- Comprehensive audit
- Ingredient sourcing verified
- Kitchen inspection
- Staff training
- Annual renewal
- Cost: Rp 3-8 million/year

Benefits:
- Logo on storefront
- Trust from customers (87% Muslim!)
- Can supply to government, schools
- Chain restaurant requirement
```

**Muslim-Operated** (No certification but halal):
```
Most warungs:
- Owner is Muslim
- No pork, no alcohol
- Inherently halal
- Don't need formal certification
- Customers trust based on ownership
```

**Non-Halal** (Clearly marked):
```
Chinese restaurants:
- Serve pork (babi)
- Must display "Non-Halal" sign
- Separate areas in food courts
- 5-10% of market only
- Mainly Chinese Indonesian customers
```

---

### Operational Considerations

**Halal Kitchen Practices**:
```
Ingredients:
- All meat must come from halal slaughterhouse
- No pork (babi) anywhere
- No alcohol in cooking
- Check processed food labels (many have halal logo)

Cross-Contamination:
- If shared kitchen with non-halal:
  * Separate utensils (different colored)
  * Separate prep areas
  * Separate storage
  * Staff trained on separation

Pure Halal Kitchen (99% of warungs):
- All ingredients halal
- No risk
- Customer confidence high
```

No Physical Storefront: Lower cost
100% Delivery: GoFood, GrabFood, ShopeeFood
Multiple Brands: One kitchen, 3-5 virtual brands
```

2. "Ayam Geprek Express" (Smashed chicken)
3. "Mie Ayam Enak" (Chicken noodles)
4. "Burger Mantap" (Burgers)
5. "Es Teh Segar" (Drinks)

All from ONE kitchen!
Different menus, different branding, same production
```

**Economics** (Cloud Kitchen - 3 Brands):
```
Setup:
- Rent: Rp 8M-15M (commercial kitchen, no storefront!)
- Equipment: Standard kitchen
- No tables, no AC for customers (huge savings!)

3 Virtual Brands:
Brand 1: Indonesian (100 orders/day × Rp 30k) = Rp 3M
Brand 2: Fried Chicken (80 orders × Rp 35k) = Rp 2.8M

```
