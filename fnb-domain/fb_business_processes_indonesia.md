```

- Price spike patterns (seasonal, weather)
- Alert when chicken >Rp 85k/kg

Menu Optimization:

WhatsApp to regular customers:
- "Today's special: Ikan Nila Rp 18k (chicken price up)"
```

---

#### 4. Lunch Hour Capacity

- "ROI of lunch helper: 220%"

Pre-Order System:
- WhatsApp pre-orders 1 hour ahead

---

#### 5. Regional Pricing Strategy

**Problem**:

- Yogyakarta rent: Rp 3M, wages: Rp 2.5M, spending: Rp 20k
- Medan rent: Rp 4M, wages: Rp 3M, spending: Rp 25k
