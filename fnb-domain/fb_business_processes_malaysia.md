## Financial Metrics

### Malaysia-Specific KPIs

**Mamak Shop Metrics**:

**Revenue Targets by Daypart**:
```
Breakfast (6am-10am):
- Poor: <RM 600
- Average: RM 800-1,000
- Good: >RM 1,200

Lunch (11am-2pm):
- Poor: <RM 800
- Average: RM 1,000-1,300
- Good: >RM 1,500

Dinner (6pm-10pm):
- Poor: <RM 1,000
- Average: RM 1,200-1,600
- Good: >RM 1,800

Supper (10pm-6am): ← KEY METRIC!
- Poor: <RM 500
- Average: RM 700-1,000
- Good: >RM 1,200
```

**Supper Revenue % of Total**:
```
Target: 20-30% of daily revenue
Industry Benchmark: 24%
Alert: <15% (not capitalizing on USP)
Opportunity: >30% possible with events (soccer matches, holidays)
```

**Labor to Revenue Ratio**:
```
Ideal: 22-26%
Calculation: All labor costs / Revenue
Mamak Challenge: 24hr means higher labor %

3 shifts × 3 workers = 9 workers/day
Monthly cost: RM 35,000-45,000
Target Revenue: RM 150,000-180,000
= 19-25% (good)
```

---

### Kopitiam Metrics

**Drinks Revenue %**:
```
Drinks should be: 60-70% of kopitiam operator revenue
(Higher margin than stall rent)

Target: RM 15,000 drinks / RM 22,000 total = 68%
```

**Peak Hour Performance**:
```
Breakfast Peak (7:30-9:30am):
- Should generate: 40-50% of daily drinks revenue
- Cups served: 80-120 in 2 hours
- Revenue: RM 200-360

Alert: <35% breakfast revenue = weak breakfast performance
```

---

### Ramadan Impact (Critical for Malaysia!)

**Revenue Spike During Ramadan Month**:
```
Normal Month: RM 100,000
Ramadan Month: RM 130,000-150,000 (+30-50%)

Why:
- Buka puasa (breaking fast) rush
- Sahur (pre-dawn meal) opportunities
- Iftar catering
- Charitable giving (people more generous)

Revenue by Time:
Normal Day: Evening 30% of daily
Ramadan: Buka puasa hour (7pm) = 45% of daily!

Preparation:
- Stock up ingredients
- Extra staff for buka puasa rush
- Special Ramadan menu
- Iftar packages (set meals for groups)
```

**Buka Puasa Economics**:
```
A good Ramadan month can make up for 2 slow months!

Mamak Shop Example:
Normal 11 months: RM 100k/month = RM 1.1M
Ramadan month: RM 150k
Annual: RM 1.25M

Ramadan represents: 12% of annual revenue in 8% of time (1/12 months
```

## Challenges & BI Solutions

### Malaysia F&B Pain Points

#### 1. Ramadan Revenue Planning

**Problem**:
- Need to prepare for 30-50% revenue spike
- Over-order ingredients = waste
- Under-order = sold out, lost revenue

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Ramadan Revenue Optimizer"
Track:
- Historical Ramadan vs normal month patterns
- Buka puasa hour concentration (6:30-8pm)
- Popular iftar items
- Ingredient usage multiplier

Forecast:
- Expected daily revenue during Ramadan
- Ingredient order recommendations
- Staff scheduling for buka puasa rush

Output: "Order X% more ingredients than normal"
```

---

#### 2. Supper Time Profitability (Mamak)

**Problem**:
- Is staying open 24hr worth it?
- What if close at 12am vs 3am vs 24hr?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Supper Hour ROI Calculator"
Compare:
- Revenue by hour (10pm, 12am, 2am, 4am)
- Labor cost for night shift
- Utilities (AC running 24hr)

Analysis:
- "Midnight-6am generates RM 600, costs RM 450 in labor"
- "ROI: 33% margin"
- "Closing at 2am vs 24hr saves RM 300, loses RM 200 revenue"

Recommendation: Optimize closing time based on location
```

---

#### 3. Halal vs Non-Halal Segregation

**Problem**:
- Mall food courts with both sections
- Which section performs better?
- Should expand halal or non-halal stalls?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Halal Section Performance"
KPIs:
- Revenue: Halal vs Non-Halal sections
- Customer count by section
- Average Bill: Halal vs Non-Halal
- Peak hours by section

Insights:
- Halal section: 65% of revenue
- Non-halal: 35% but higher margin (pork dishes)

- Dinner: 50/50 split
```

---

#### 4. E-Wallet vs Cash Optimization

**Problem**:
- Should invest in e-wallet setup?
- What's the customer preference trend?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Payment Method Transition Tracker"
Track:
- Cash vs e-wallet % monthly
- Average transaction by payment (e-wallet users spend more?)
- Age demographic by payment
- Lost sales estimate (digital-only customers avoiding cash-only stalls)

Trend:
- E-wallet growing 3-5% monthly
- Younger customers (25-40) prefer digital 80%
- Older (50+) still 70% cash

ROI:
- E-wallet setup: RM 0 (free QR code)
- Potential revenue increase: +8-12% (attract digital customers)
```

---

#### 5. Regional Pricing Optimization

**Problem**:
- Operating in multiple states (KL, Penang, Johor)
- What's optimal price by location?

**BI Solution**:
```
Dashboard: "Regional Price Optimizer"
Compare:
- KL rent vs Penang rent
- Customer willingness to pay by state
- Competition baseline pricing
- Operating costs variance

Recommendation:
- KL: RM 8 (higher rent justifies)
- Penang: RM 6.50 (tourist + local balance)
- Johor: RM 6 (compete with SG visitors expectations)
```
